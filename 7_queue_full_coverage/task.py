# TASK:
#
# Achieve full statement coverage on the Queue class.
# You will need to:
# 1) Write your test code in the test function.
# 2) Press submit. The grader will tell you if you
#    fail to cover any specific part of the code.
# 3) Update your test function until you cover the
#    entire code base.
#
# You can also run your code through a code coverage
# tool on your local machine if you prefer. This is
# not necessary, however.
# If you have any questions, please don't hesitate
# to ask in the forums!
